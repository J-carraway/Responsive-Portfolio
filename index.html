      <p>My name is Joshua Carraway. Certains things in my life bring me joy between hanging with my girlfriend, playing xbox with my friends, or just hanging out with my dog. This class is something I find very interesting and challenging at the same time. It has taught me many things and I do believe I am on way to becoming a 
                web developer. Being at Texas Christian Univeristy taught me that with hardwork and dedication you can do anything you want to. Playing football there was an exciting and important part of my life. I enjoyed the time I had there, it gave me many great memories and great friends.
